## Values
**Excellence**
Excellence is not an occasional act, but a persistent habit. We strive to inspire others not only by what we do, but how we do it. We emphasize building trust for our coworkers and clients by delivering results that continuously exceed their expectations. This requires a unique combination of extraordinary resourcefulness and confident humility.

**Dedication**
Dedication involves thinking of others more, without thinking less of ourselves. Improving is more than a company; it is a business family. As a result, it is important that we own the company name as if it were our own. We are generous with our time, knowledge, and experience and we regularly celebrate the achievements of others.

**Involvement**
Our success is a consequence of our collective Involvement. Greatness is never guaranteed, and it is rarely achieved by doing the minimum. As a result, Improving encourages our employees to creatively contribute in areas outside of their every day responsibilities, including the active planning and commitment to their own learning and growth.
