# Struggle Bus

note:
- I've never been someone who's organized
	- Classic student that waited to the last moment and never used a calendar for anything
- Everyone is trying to 'get organized' on their meetings, daily tasks, projects
	- It's alluring to hear about one more thing that can 'solve' your task/project/meeting/calendar problems
	- Constantly disappointed: Pen/Paper, Wunderlist, Microsoft ToDo, Email Flagging, Time Blocking, Kanban, all failed me in one way or another

# Why does Obsidian stick so well?

Why does Obsidian stick so well?

- Low barrier to entry
- High ceiling for creativity
- Wide variety of use
- Change is not punishing

note:

Low Barrier: It does what it says on the tin, fits all my developer skills already
High Ceiling/Wide Variety: It ticks all the boxes for easy system design, I love designing systems
And if Change is punishing, get out of obsidian and script it!
