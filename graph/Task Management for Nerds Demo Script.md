*Ok, but like, how do I apply these?*

Some Ideas:

- One off tasks can just go in your [[2022-07-31|journal]] daily entry
- Maybe you generate a task view by default for people or projects
- Recurring tasks can go on the page of the thing they most associate with, maybe a [[Civic Honda Maintenance Schedule|project]] or a [[Eric Sowell|person]]?
- What about if I want to figure out what my tasks for the [[2022-W32|week]] are?
- Meetings are a great place to have action items created, but have surface in a daily journal

*What is a project?*

A project is just a page that you can rally tasks around, and is likely a good candidate for recurring tasks

*Cool, what next?*

- Something I want to try out is the [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/)
- I want to try and use [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) instead of Templates plugin to make my project templates smarter
	- Millions of links back to the project feels cluttered, tags are likely better but can't have spaces
